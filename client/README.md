# Black Codher Personal Personal Project - Client side (frontend)

All of your front end code should be in this folder.

Once you have your development environment up and running you'll be able to see the app running here:

```plain
http://localhost:3000
```

## Example App

In the example we have provided the below for you to see:

1. How to display a list of profiles
2. How to connect to your API
3. What to display if your request to the API doesn't return any profiles

## Connecting to your API

In the `services/` folder there is an example [`profileService.js`](./src/services/profileService.js). The sole purpose of this file is to create various fetch requests to our profile API and return the data to be used by any component.

You can see an example of a get request using the popular javascript library [axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/example). Axios can help us save time by writing less code amongst it's many benefits.

## Getting Started

If you prefer to run the front end in isolation from the back end you can do so by running the below command to start it up:

```shell
npm start
```
